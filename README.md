# SQL Developer Internship – Task 2

This repository contains the SQL script for Task 2 of the SQL Developer Internship.

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to understand SQL data types, constraints, and table design, and to learn how to modify table structures using SQL commands.

## What This Task Covers
- Designing a table using appropriate SQL data types
- Applying constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE
- Inserting records into the table
- Retrieving data using SELECT queries
- Filtering records using WHERE conditions
- Modifying table structure using ALTER TABLE
- Adding, renaming, and dropping columns
- Adding constraints using ALTER TABLE

## Files Included
- `task2.sql` – SQL script demonstrating table creation, constraints, data insertion, and table modifications

## Constraints Used
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures each record is uniquely identifiable
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures mandatory fields always contain values
- **UNIQUE**: Prevents duplicate entries for columns such as email and roll number

## Notes
- Standard SQL syntax is used.
- Browser-based SQL tools were used as permitted in the task instructions.
